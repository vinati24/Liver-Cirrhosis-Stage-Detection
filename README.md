# Liver-Cirrhosis-Stage-Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of detecting the stages of liver cirrhosis using machine learning techniques. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building to accurately classify different stages of the disease.

Liver cirrhosis is a chronic disease that progresses through various stages, leading to severe liver dysfunction. Early detection of the cirrhosis stage can help clinicians intervene effectively. This project leverages machine learning models to detect and classify the stages of cirrhosis from patient data.

The notebook includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Model building and evaluation (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

# Results
After running the notebook, you will get:

A trained model capable of predicting cirrhosis stages.

Graphs visualizing feature importance and model accuracy.

Insights from various performance metrics (e.g., ROC curves).
